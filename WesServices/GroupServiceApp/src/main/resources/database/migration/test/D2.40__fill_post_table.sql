Astra Antiqua contains more than 70 Latin mythological stories about Hercules, Perseus, and others. These versions of the stories were originally written by R. B. Appleton, and published in 1914 under the title Fabulae Virginibus Puerisque aut Narrandae aut Recitandae. Appleton also included a thorough glossary of terms perhaps unknown by intermediate readers. This glossary can be consulted when necessary, and students should have a grammar available for more difficult passages. The editors have added illustrations taken from Johann Bayer''s Uranometria, a celestial atlas from the 17th century. You can find it on Amazon. Enjoy!'),
